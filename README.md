# Part 3
This part introduces production-ready practices such as container optimization and deployment pipelines. We’ll also familiarize ourselves with other container orchestration solutions. By the end of this part you are able to:
- Critically examine the images that you pull
- Trim the container size and image build time via multiple methods such as multi-stage builds.
- Automatically deploy containers

## Exercises
### 3.1 A deployment pipeline to heroku
Let’s create our first deployment pipeline!
For this exercise you can select which ever web application you already have containerized.
If you don’t have any web applications available you can use any one from this course and modify it. (Such as the course material itself)
Use GitHub, Github Actions, and Heroku to deploy a container to heroku. You can also use other CI/CD tools instead of GitHub Actions.
Submit a link to the repository with the config.
